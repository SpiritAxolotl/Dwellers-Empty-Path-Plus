# Dweller's Empty Path Plus

This is an "improved" version of our beloved RPG Maker game. Started in the summer of 2020, around a month after the original game's release, went in hiatus for god knows how long, and finally back in 2024 for the 4th anniversary of the game.

This game is supposed to be the sequel of Escaped Chasm, so be sure to play that before starting this one!

Also, please, support the original creator, Temmie Chang, and all the other amazing people behind the original game, such as Camellia and Toby Fox.

## FEATURES (spoiler warning!)

- The game is now available also for Linux and macOS!! (I am unsure if they work, please, let me know.)
- Game is now WAY MORE performant thanks to the updated NW library and some new plugins.
- Fixed a MAJOR bug where the game would freeze randomly in newer versions of Windows (thanks TheAM-Dol for it!!).
- Fixed a MAJOR bug where the game would randomly get stuck in the background after closing it in newer versions of Windows, disallowing it to be opened again unless you terminate the stuck process (thanks inc0der for it!!).
- The trailer now plays when starting the game, before the Title Screen (skippable).
- Fixed minor punctuation and grammar errors.
- Custom dialogue sound for the Hint Bird and all the other birds (why not?).
- A brand-new Menu, accessible with ESCAPE/X.
- Yoki's Journal; always be able to save through the menu (optional and only unlocked after completing the game, the bad ending doesn't count).
- Hint Medal; always be able to access hints through the menu (optional and only unlocked after completing the game, the bad ending doesn't count).
- Charles' Journal; always be able to check his journal through the menu (optional and only unlocked after reading it completely).
- Some duplicated Events for interactions and collisions have been made to start the (now defined) "main Event" instead of its contents (dialogues, cutscenes...) being duplicated multiple times. Complicated to explain.
- Many re-used Events have been turned into Common Events.
- A 4th anniversary thank you message after the True Ending cutscene.
- Temmie's Bonus Room now has a new room...
- New data added for how many times you have opened, saved, loaded, and completed the game. Also, for the endings and bad endings that you got. You can see them by talking to the frog in Temmie's Bonus Room (which no longer suggests you to ignore Zera, since I redeemed it to be extremely unnecessary because it is already hinted in the main gameplay).
- No more ugly screen blur in the Title Screen's options.
- Title Screen's options have been reworked and feature more of them, such as VSync, a Super-Speed option if you feel Yoki's movement speed in the game is too slow for your likings (boo...), and more!
- Fixed a bug with closing the Title Screen's options that made the Title Screen play again its fade in animation.
- Repositioned a bit some Title Screen elements.
- You can now access the options in-game through the Menu.
- Improved game window.
- A new icon and changed stuff involving the game's title for the plus mod.
- Second cutscene picture of Zera Ending's Yoki's House door cutscene has been changed to fix the vibe of the cutscene in a better way.
- Yoki has more interactions and comments a bit more during the Zera Ending.
- The Intro Nightmare's text is now fully shaky.
- The arrows showing up at the bottom of Sei's dialogues in the True Ending no longer show, like any other dialogue in the game.
- Removed useless unused images used as a placeholder for some RPG Maker MV assets that were never meant to be used. As well as some other unused data.
- All the audio of the game gets slowed down by 20% after finishing reading Charles' Journal (not through the Menu), until you go to sleep, to accentuate even more Yoki being mentally exhausted.
- Fixed wrong black palette color in the tilesets.
- You might have a chance of entering Zera's Room now without any cheats after completing the Zera Ending and going back to his manor...
- Camera zooms out/in dynamically in Castle-Town!
- New special interaction with the Knight Hero in Castle-Town's Inn after collecting the Broken Bottle.
- New special interaction with Claire after the Flying Broom Ride.
- Gave a hidden bunny in the Village unique interactions... and hunger.
- You can now buy clothes for Yoki in Castle-Town using money.
- Every sign, book, letter, diary...'s dialogues now show its text uniquely.
- Existing smooth fade in transitions now have the in-style "blocky" transition.
- Added missing hitboxes for some save points.
- Added extra hitboxes for some interactions, such as for the Library's librarian, Este's Post Office, Caina's Caf√© and more.
- Deleted useless, unreachable hitboxes.
- The game will fix some stuff if you try to use a save file from the original game. Hopefully this makes them fully compatible with DEP+, try them out! (Be sure to make a backup first, of course)
- Fixed some grammar/dialogue mistakes and inconsistencies.
- Made some repeated dialogues and interactions trigger the same exact one instead of having duplicated of them.
- New dialogues for some animals, some of the Village's stands, and more.
- Zera in the Bonus Room will now only disappear after you interact with him.
- Zera will now disappear also if you go below the right side of the Cliffs and if you enter the Cave near him.

This might not be everything, though... discover the rest by yourself! ;)
